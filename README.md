# Meta-debugger
A meta debugging tool

Brief, overall rundown:
* Use the combined or collective functions of other/multiple dubuggers to accomplishes a certain task.

* Incoprerates other debuggers into its code and/or programming

* Recursive and self-improving capabilities

* Multifunctional -- capable of many functions as reqiured or needed.

* Multimodal -- capable taking many roles and activities as reqiured or needed.

* Can create or develope new dubugger software and programes. Can also innovate or improve/update existing dubbuging software that a user might have up to current 
 standards (if the user so desire).

Aim is to meet _virtually_ and technically meet all of a user/business/enterprises' debugging needs.

Note: Future debugging softwares that may come out or be released in the future within the realm of computer science, this program could technially incorperate such debbugers into its own functioning/program OR utitlize them in its workflow and/or operations. Truly staying with the times (and its standards) and adapting to the ever-evolving
